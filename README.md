Buying or selling a used car can be a frustrating experience, especially with the risk of scams and dishonest pricing from dealerships or individual sellers. This project aims to ease that process by building a machine learning model that can estimate the fair value of a used car based on factors like the make and model, mileage, damage history, parts value, and overall roadworthiness. With this tool, sellers can better decide whether to sell the car as-is, invest in repairs first, or sell it for parts. Buyers, on the other hand, get a realistic idea of the car’s worth and any likely repair costs—helping both sides make smarter, more informed decisions.
